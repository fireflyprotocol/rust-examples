Repo containing rust code samples to interact with the Bluefin protocol

### Arb Order Signing
In order to interact with our on-chain protocol, users must sign their orders off-chain before they can be posted to our orderbooks. The project shows how to generate an EIP-712 signature for the order.

### Arb Order Cancellation
To cancel an order, a user must sign a cancellation hash based on the order hash. The project shows how to generate an EIP-712 cancellation signature for a particular order. The input can be either be the order itself or its hash (generated by Arb Order Signing project).

### Arb Onboarding Signer
Bluefin requires users to on-board onto the exchange by signing a message off-chain using their wallet/account and sending it to exchange before they can start trading on our platform. The project provides an example on how to generate the onboarding signature.
